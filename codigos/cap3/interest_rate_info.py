# A person invests $1000 in a savings account yielding 5 percent interest. Assuming that all
# interest is left on deposit in the account, calculate and print the amount of money in the
# account at the end of each year for 10 years. Use the following formula for determining
# these amounts:

# a = p * ( 1 + r ) ** n

# where
# p is the original amount invested (i.e., the principal),
# r is the annual interest rate,
# n is the number of years and
# a is the amount on deposit at the end of the nth year.
